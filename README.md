# schwab_api_testing
Python API endpoints for testing you API 

This implementation creates a FastAPI application with multiple endpoints for different types of orders as described in the Schwab Trader API documentation. 

To use this API:

Save the code in a file, e.g., main.py.
Install the required packages: pip install fastapi uvicorn
Run the server: python main.py

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000. You can access the OpenAPI documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs, which will allow you to test the endpoints and see the required request bodies for each order type.
